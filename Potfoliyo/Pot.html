                        <h3>Frontend<span>Developer</span></h3>
                        <p>I'm 20 year old Front-end Developer  who has 
                            worked with some big brands that you surely know. I have been
                            working in the field since I was 18.I received a lot of 
                            information and I felt like all my skills were gone: not coding
                            for 4 weeks is actually long. They briefly introduced their
                            main projects and then asked me to run one of them in a virtual
                            machine… uh whaaat? I haven't done that before… And I felt
                            quite overwhelmed not being familiar with Laravel either.
                            With the help of the senior back end developer, we managed 
                            to make it work even if I only contextualised what I was 
                            doing later when I went home. I started reading and listening to 
                            tutorials and i put everything in</p>
